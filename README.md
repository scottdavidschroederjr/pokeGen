This tool uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to pull data from the [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/) website to display the info in a chart on a [React](https://react.dev/) site.

## To run:
- npm start in the my-app directory
    - if the error "react-scripts is not recognized" is thrown, run npm install react-scripts first
- node server.js in the src directory

## Reflections
This project was finished on 6/16/23 and this reflection is being written on 10/30/24 in an effort to increase the readability of past github projects as well as to better communicate what I have learned through these endevors. However this distance from the project means that these reflections aren't going to be nearly as sharp or insightful as they would have been when the project was fresh in my mind (which is the first major takeaway from this undertaking of unearthing my previous work).

Based on what I wanted this site to accomplish, I feel like React was a bit of overkill but I'm glad I got to dive into it a bit to learn the basics in case it was needed in the future. This was the first of a string of projects that used react to display infomation and from those, I've learned that getting the info I want to be displayed scratches my brain much more than making sure the info is displayed in a pretty fashion.
